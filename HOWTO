1. Building

You need KDE SC 4.4 installed with complete development/header files. This
means installed make, cmake, and g++ compiler, as well as kdelibs5-devel
packages. Please refer to your distributions forum for exact package names.

To build, type the following commands in Konsole:

    cd containmentaction-favorites-0.2
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=`kde4-config --prefix` ..
    make


2. Installing

To install, you need root password:

    sudo make install


3. Restart KDE

Before being able to use the plugin, you need to restart KDE.


4. Configuration

After restart, click on desktop with right mouse button, and select "Desktop
Settings". Choose symbol "Mouse Actions" in the settings dialog, and click
"Add Action..." button. Then click on this button "Input Here..." with the
mouse button that should invoke the favorites menu (I use left button).

Then in the combobox next to this button select the "Favorites Launcher", and
hit OK. You should now be able to invoke the favorites menu by clicking on
the desktop with the button you specified in the settings dialog.

To change the entries that are visible in the menu, use the Kickoff menu.
