Favorites launcher

This simple mouse action plugin for Plasma Desktop 4.4 allows
to launch the favorite applications from the kickoff menu.

I only did some small modifications to the application launcher
plugin written by Chani Armitage (many thanks!).

This is distributed under the LGPL 2+ license, see the header
text in launch.cpp and COPYING.LIB for details.

Please see HOWTO for information about installation and usage.

Thanks and enjoy!
